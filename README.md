## Hi there 👋

I am currently studying Electronic Information Engineering at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and will become a master's student at FNL, BUPT.
 
My **current research** mainly includes network routing, SDN, OVS, etc., and I am working hard to learn the relevant foundational knowledge.🆙

In addition, I have a deep passion for 🎧 **music** and am learning about harmony, orchestration, etc., striving to become an **all-in-one music producer**！
